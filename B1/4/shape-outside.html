Salmon are one of the most beloved kinds of edible fish, 
but the story of how your lox bagel or Philadelphia roll got from
water to plate is often an unsavory one. For centuries, salmon have
suffered a tsunami of setbacks from overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, 
climate change, and hydraulic dams. And salmon farms - often touted as a solution
to the problems that plague wild salmon - can do more harm than good. </p>

Mark Kurlansky, the author of Cod and Salt, has returned with a new book
titled Salmon: A fish, the Earth, and the History of Their Common Fate. More than
just a comprehensive biography of salmon. it's also an allegory of the human tendency
to conflate develoment projects with progress, even if the ensuing environmental destruction
is counterproductive. In a recent conversation with Oceana, Kurlansky discussed the threats that
salmon face, as well as the future of these popular fish.
