    <p>Oceana campaigns in eight countries and the European Union to save the oceans and feed the world. While we share a common goal, our countries are unique in their ecosystems and their fisheries. And Chile, where Oceana has worked since 2003, is a great example – it’s a productive coastal country with some the world’s most biodiverse ocean territories. Below you will find a conversation I recently had with the Vice President of Oceana in Chile, Liesbeth van der Meer, about Oceana’s long list of victories and the current challenges Chile faces from COVID-19. </p>    
    <p>When I came back to Chile and joined Oceana, I faced the real world. The industry, the artisanal fishermen, and the theory collided into this very unknown world of practicality and how the model of fisheries recovery actually works on the ground. Eventually, I started going to local communities of fishermen to see how we could solve the issue of illegal fishing together.</p>
    <p>That’s when I started to see these human beings who love what they do. They are passionate about getting up at 4:00 in the morning and going to fish. Sometimes they don’t catch anything. But just the act of going fishing at 4:00 in the morning, coming back at 10:00, selling the fish, and then going home, I think that’s what really taught me how important it is to be a scientist, but also to understand that there is this human side to fisheries that is very beautiful in Chile.</p>
